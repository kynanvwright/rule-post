    - option to relax this for overwrite
- When they are responding to the correct round (block responses to old rounds)

Team comments:
- When teamsCanRespond is false, and teamsCanComment is true
- When they are responding to comments in the correct round (block responses to old round responses)
- No limit on frequency (yet)

RC response:
