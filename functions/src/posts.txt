Pseudo Code for figuring out when different permissions are allowed, prior to coding.

Enquiries:
- All teams and RC permitted to submit at any time
- altered timeline option for RC only (future)

Team responses:
- When teamsCanRespond is true
- When they have no other unpublished responses in that round
    - option to relax this for overwrite
- When they are responding to the correct round (block responses to old rounds)

Team comments:
- When teamsCanRespond is false, and teamsCanComment is true
- When they are responding to comments in the correct round (block responses to old round responses)
- No limit on frequency (yet)

RC response:
- When teamsCanRespond is false
- When they are responding to the correct round

Pseudocode for publishing function

- search through enquiries, responses, comments
- skip whenever an enquiry "isClosed"
- only search the latest rounds
- find ones with isPublished = false and switch to true
- send email alerts
- run every 12 hours at the publishing time
- think about what to do for RC responses (publish at nearest time or end of phase)
  - could be toggleable
- note that I need a better check for responses, as they should be delayed longer
